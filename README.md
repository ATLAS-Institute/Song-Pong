# SongPong
# Song Pong is an interactive installation that allows people to come together to make music collaboratively, through the familiar game of Cup Pong 
#
# The two final files to be used are both named SongPong which are Arduino and Max files. To start, open the Arduino file and run the code. Once it is running, open the Max patch, turn on sound and click the button in the top left that turns on Serial communication. Then you will have to choose the output port. If you do not know your out port, there is a print button next to the on button. Hit that, and then check the console and it will tell you the correct port. If there is not an accurate port button for your port, create a new one using a message. Then, to play, open presentation mode for a simply selection process for the songs.
